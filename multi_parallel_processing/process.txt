Process: An instance of a program

pros
1. takes advantage of multiple CPUs an cores
2. separate memory space -> memory is not shared between processes
3. great for CPU-bound processing
4. new process is stated independently from other processes
5. processes are interruptable/killable
6. one GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

cons
1. heavyweight
2. starting a process is slower than starting a thread
3. more memory
4. IPC, inter-process communication is more complicated
